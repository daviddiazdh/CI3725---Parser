# 🧠 CI3725 — Micro Parser

This project implements a micro parser capable of **translating code** from an **Imperative Language** to a **Lambda Language**.

---

## 📄 First Step: Lexer

The **Lexer** is the module responsible for recognizing valid and invalid tokens. It outputs either:
- A list of recognized tokens, or
- A list of lexical errors (if any are found)

> ⚠️ This step is **essential** for all subsequent stages of the parser.

### 📦 Usage

```bash
python lexer.py [file]
```

- [file] must be a .imperat file

## 👓 Second Step: Parser

The **Parser** is the module responsible for determine the grammar and identify codes which satisfy this grammar. It outputs either:
- A structural tree code, or
- A list of grammar errors

> ⚠️ This step is **essential** for all subsequent stages of the parser.

## 👓 Third Step: Parser – Type and Context Error Recognizer
The **Type and Context Error Recognizer** component enhances the parser with additional rule checks to detect both type and context errors. Up to this point, the parser can successfully identify all type errors in the Imperat language.

> ⚠️ This step is **essential** for all subsequent stages of the parser.

## 🗣️ Fourth Step: Translator
The Translator component converts the AST generated by the previous components into Lambda Calculus expressed in Python. It is integrated within the parser.py file.

> ⚠️ This step is **essential** for all subsequent stages of the parser.

### 📦 Usage

```bash
python parser.py [file]
```

- [file] must be a .imperat file
